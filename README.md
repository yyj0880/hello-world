# hello-world

Ah hello everyone. I am Eugene and today is 16/07/2017. 
Literally I am just at a crossroad of my life, which is about what to do next, find a job or get porstgraduate study.
Woa, such a catch-22.
However, I think I am very lucky. For what? Karen. She is my girlfriend and we are fall in love with each other now.
She attracts me a lot, not only corresponding to her beauty, but also because she is my soulmate. She can back me up, she can cheer me up, sheÂ is virtuous... Also, she makes me feel the great sense of responsibility.
Whatever happens next, I wish both of us a better life, a bright future. Best wishes!
I love you, Karen, and my love will travel over land and water, to beats you.
